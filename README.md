## Problem Statement: 
â€¢ Agriculture sector in India holds the record for second-largest agricultural land in the world generating employment for about half of the country's population. However, its contribution accounts for only 20% to the countryâ€™s GDP. There is a need to increase the output of the sector to meet the ever-increasing demand.  
â€¢ Indian farmers arenâ€™t able to choose the optimal crop based on their soil requirements depending upon factors like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, pH.   
â€¢ About 30-35% of the annual crop yield in India gets wasted because of plant diseases and pest attacks.  

## Solution: 
â€¢ Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.   
â€¢ We developed Agrify- a one stop solution for farmers introducing them to the concept of precise farming. â€¢ Precision agriculture (PA) is the science of improving crop yields and assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and analysis tools.   
â€¢ We pbuilt a Crop recommender system, which takes into account the essential land requirements for farming, like nutrient concentration, soil pH etc and external factors as temperature, humidity, etc to recommend a crop to a farmer that would give optimal output in the given conditions.   
â€¢ Crop loss due to plant diseases can be controlled to a great extent if curated at an early stage. We therefore developed a plant disease detection system to aid farmers identify diseases to prevent crop loss. We propose to use the IntelÂ® oneAPI AI Analtyics toolkit for optimising our application with the help of IntelÂ® optimised python packages, including but not limited to IntelÂ® optimised Scikit-Learn and Modin libraries for data-preprocessing and AI TensorFlow Kit for Image Preprocessing for Plant Disease detection.   

## Future Scope: 
â€¢ An optimal utilisation of our proposed Agrify application would help boost the crop production. It would reduce food shortages, generate more employment, and industrialise agriculture as the pillar of the Indian economy.
